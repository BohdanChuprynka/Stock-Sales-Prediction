# Background 
The Stock Sales Prediction is a personal project that I did over the summer to improve my Data Science skills. I chose this dataset to showcase and work on my skills during the cleaning and training process. Because of the data that contains this dataset, I would be able to challenge myself for different problems and experiment on different solutions. After completing this project on August 12, 2024, I truly believe that the effort I put in this project will pay me off.
